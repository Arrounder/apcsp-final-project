            <span style="font-size: 70px;">Gump</span> is portrayed as viewing the world simply and truthfully. He does not know what he wants to do in life, but despite his low IQ, he is made out to be full of wisdom. He says that he "can think things pretty good", but when he tries "sayin or writin them, it kinda come out like Jello". His mathematical abilities as an idiot savant and feats of strength lead him into all kinds of adventures.
