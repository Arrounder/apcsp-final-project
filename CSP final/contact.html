            Visual effects of the movie</h3>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 70px;">B</span>lack-and-white film screenshot showing the main character on the left looking toward another man, President Kennedy, (voiced by actor Jed Gillin), on the right. Kennedy is smiling and looking to his left. In the background, several men are looking in different directions and one is aiming a camera.</p>
        <p>Ken Ralston and his team at Industrial Light and Magic were responsible for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used and with the help of such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.</p>
        <p>In one Vietnam War scene, Gump carries Bubba away from an incoming napalm attack. To create the effect, stunt actors were initially used for compositing purposes. Then, Hanks and Williamson were filmed, with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him. The explosion was then filmed, and the actors were digitally added to appear just in front of the explosions. The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI.
